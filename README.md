If you're using content dimensions in your Neos setup, we will retrieve the content language 
from the currently active content dimension. However, if you are not using this feature of Neos, 
you need to define the default content language in the configuration, like this:

### Permissions

By default, every editor can use the assistant.
However, if you want to restrict the access to certain roles,
you can copy this configuration into your site package.
It will give you an additional role `AiAssistantEditor`.

```yaml
roles:
  'Neos.Neos:AbstractEditor':
    privileges:
      - privilegeTarget: NEOSidekick.AiAssistant:CanUse
        permission: ABSTAIN

  'NEOSidekick.AiAssistant:AiAssistantEditor':
    description: Grants access to the NEOSidekick AiAssistant sidebar
    privileges:
      - privilegeTarget: NEOSidekick.AiAssistant:CanUse
        permission: GRANT

  'Neos.Neos:Administrator':
    privileges:
      - privilegeTarget: NEOSidekick.AiAssistant:CanUse
        permission: GRANT
```

Of course, you can also define the privilege for any
other role that you are using for example `Neos.Neos:Administrator`.

### Page-specific AI briefings

By default, we add the mixin `NEOSidekick.AiAssistant:Mixin.AiPageBriefing` to the Neos.Neos:Document NodeType to allow editors to fine-tune the NEOSidekick AI Assistant behavior. 
Advanced users can also build their own based on the [NEOSidekick YAML API](https://neosidekick.com/en/product/features/build-your-own-ai#page-specific-briefings).

### SEO Image Alternative Text Generator

Images boost user engagement, but search engines can't interpret visualsâ€”they rely on alt text. 

The [Image Description Generator](#image-description-generator) helps you create effective descriptions for your media. This improves the searchability of extensive media libraries and by serving as a [fallback alternative text for images](https://neosidekick.com/en/product/features/image-description-generator) it makes your site more accessible. To craft SEO-optimized alt texts, it's crucial to understand the page content and context. The same image can need different descriptions depending on how it's used. Since Neos NodeTypes do not automatically link image attributes to alt text properties, you must [configure these details for NEOSidekick in YAML](https://neosidekick.com/produkt/features/property-text-generieren#alt-tags). After this setup, you can generate SEO-friendly alt texts directly in the Neos content editor. Here, you can also systematically apply these alt texts on bulk.

NEOSidekick can identify the most relevant pages for you and provide suggestions for each image title and alternative text of these pages.
