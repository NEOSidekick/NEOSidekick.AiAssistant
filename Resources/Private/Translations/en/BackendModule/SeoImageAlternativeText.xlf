                Images can significantly enhance user engagement, but search engines can't see images; they read the alt text. <br><br>
                You can use the <a href="/neos/ai-assistant/alternate-image-text-generator" style="text-decoration:underline">Image Alternative Text Generator</a> to create descriptions for the media management. This makes it easier to search large media libraries, and as a <a href="https://neosidekick.com/en/product/features/image-description-generator" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">fallback for images</a> it increases the accessibility of your website.<br><br>
                To create SEO optimal alternative texts, it is important to know the content of the page. The same images can require very different descriptions in different uses. Since there is no connection between the image property and the alternative text property in Neos NodeTypes, you have to <a href="https://neosidekick.com/produkt/features/property-text-generieren#alt-tags" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">configure this information for NEOSidekick in YAML</a>. After that, you can create SEO image alternative texts directly in the normal Neos content editing.<br><br>
                By systematically applying these steps, you can effectively optimize your web pages for search engines, enhancing both reach and engagement. We are also working on a backend module for creating node-based image alternative texts, <a href="mailto:mailto:support@neosidekick.com?subject=NEOSidekick%20beta%20program%20for%20node-based%20image%20alternative%20texts&body=I%20would%20like%20to%20try%20the%20tool%20and%20give%20you%20good%20feedback%20for%20early%20access." style="text-decoration: underline;">write us if you are interested in participating in the beta program.</a>]]></source>
